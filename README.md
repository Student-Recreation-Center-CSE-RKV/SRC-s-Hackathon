## Problem Statement: Revolutionizing Event Management at RGUKT RK Valley

### Overview:
Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies (RGUKT) RK Valley hosts a diverse range of events, from academic seminars and workshops to cultural festivals and sports competitions. However, managing these events efficiently remains a challenge due to the reliance on manual processes, lack of centralized information, and inadequate communication channels. This hackathon aims to revolutionize the event management system by developing a comprehensive, user-friendly software solution that streamlines the entire event lifecycle.

### Challenge:
The challenge is to develop a sophisticated event management software tailored for RGUKT RK Valley that facilitates the planning, promotion, execution, and feedback of campus events. The solution should be accessible to students, faculty, and event organizers, enhancing their ability to manage events effectively and ensuring high levels of engagement and participation.

### Objectives:
- **Automation**: Digitize and automate the event management process, from initial planning to post-event feedback.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the solution is accessible on various devices, including laptops, smartphones, and tablets, to accommodate all users.
- **Collaboration**: Enhance collaboration among event organizers, volunteers, and participants through efficient communication tools.
- **Transparency**: Provide real-time updates on event status, task assignments, and other critical information.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Incorporate data analytics to track event performance, attendance, and feedback, enabling continuous improvement.

### Features:
1. **User Authentication**: Secure login/authentication system for different user roles (students, faculty, event organizers).
2. **Event Planning and Scheduling**: Tools for creating event timelines, assigning tasks, setting deadlines, and booking venues.
3. **Event Promotion and Registration**: Features to promote events via social media, email, and in-app notifications, along with online registration and ticketing systems.
4. **Volunteer Management**: Sign-up forms, role assignments, and shift scheduling for volunteers, with communication tools for coordination.
5. **Resource Management**: System to manage resources and equipment, track availability, and allocate them efficiently.
6. **Real-Time Updates and Notifications**: Automated notifications for task deadlines, event reminders, and status updates via email, SMS, or push notifications.
7. **Feedback and Analytics**: Post-event surveys, rating systems, and data analytics dashboard for tracking event performance and identifying trends.
8. **User Dashboard**: Personalized dashboard for each user role, showing relevant information and tasks.

### Technologies:
Participants are encouraged to leverage a wide range of technologies, including but not limited to:
- Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular, etc.
- Mobile App Development: iOS, Android, Flutter, React Native, etc.
- Backend Development: Node.js, Django, Flask, Ruby on Rails, etc.
- Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase, etc.
- Cloud Services: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc.
- Machine Learning & Data Science: Predictive Analytics, Data Visualization, etc.

### Evaluation Criteria:
Submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- **Functionality**: Does the solution meet the specified objectives? Is it user-friendly and intuitive?
- **Innovation**: Does the solution incorporate innovative features or approaches to address the problem effectively?
- **Scalability**: Is the solution scalable to accommodate a large user base and handle increasing event volumes?
- **Reliability**: Is the system robust and reliable, ensuring smooth operation without frequent disruptions?
- **Impact**: What potential impact does the solution have on improving the event management process at RGUKT RK Valley?

### Deliverables:
Participants are required to submit the following deliverables:
- Fully functional prototype of the event management software.
- Documentation outlining the system architecture, design decisions, and instructions for deployment.

### Conclusion:
By developing an innovative event management software for RGUKT RK Valley, we aim to enhance the efficiency, communication, and overall experience of organizing and attending campus events. We look forward to seeing creative solutions that leverage technology to address this challenge and make a significant impact on campus life.
